# Abstract
According to the American Cancer Society, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women, with millions of new cases reported each year. Breast ccancer affects about one in eight women, making it one of the most prevalent and life-threatening cancers impacting females worldwide. Despite the advanced progress in early diagnosis, screening, and patient management, it is still the leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women. Recently, however, new studies have shown that 

Machine Learning (ML) approaches can aid in detecting breast cancer at an early stage and with high accuracy, allowing for increased survival rate because better treatment can be provided. Therefore, the objective of this study is to analyze the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset (WDBC) by applying various machine learning (ML) techniques to predict the presence of breast cancer, classifying tumor types, and identifying key features that influence diagnosis. The chosen theme is Predictive Analytics, with a focus on Classification.
